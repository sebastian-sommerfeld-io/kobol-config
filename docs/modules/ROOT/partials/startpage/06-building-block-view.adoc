. Basic packages -> Essential Tools like git, Virtualbox, Vagrant, Docker, etc. or tools that require a desktop and don't change very often like Browsers, IntelliJ, Slack, etc.
. Basic containers -> Essential containers running on the host and don't change very often - e.g. to expose metrics for monitoring purposes.
. Sandboxes -> The encapsulated which provide the actual development environment etc. -> these sandboxes probably are subject to frequent changes.
