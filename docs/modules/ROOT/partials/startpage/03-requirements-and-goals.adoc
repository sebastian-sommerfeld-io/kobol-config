== Requirements Overview
. Setup my local workstation with minimal manual interactions.
. Add or update packages without any risk -> avoid having to repair broken installations (dumping the broken setup and reverting to a working one is preferred).
. Test the setup regularly (automated) to ensure a new installation from scratch will work.

== Quality Goals
. The whole setup of my local workstation is Infrastructure as Code.
. Software installations through the classic package managers like `apt` should be avoided. As much as possible should run inside docker containers. This is true for the host machine as well as Vagrantboxes.
