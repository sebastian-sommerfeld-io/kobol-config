== Install
In order to run this project, the following dependencies must be met:

. Install Virtualbox and Vagrant
.. Install the Vagrant Plugin "link:https://github.com/leighmcculloch/vagrant-docker-compose[vagrant-docker-compose]" using `vagrant plugin install vagrant-docker-compose`
. The host machine should have git installed -> the Vagrantbox "pegasus" expects a `~/.gitconfig` file in order to copy this file into the Vagrantbox.
. The host machine should have `~/.ssh`, `~/.tmp` and `~/.work` directories -> the Vagrantbox "pegasus" expects these folders in order to copy them into the Vagrantbox

CAUTION: Since this project expects certain files and folders from the host in a Linux way, it will probably not work out-of-the-box on Windows machines. Using WSL2 on Windows might work. Note that both assumptions are not verified.
